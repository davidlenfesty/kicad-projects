# DO NOT USE THIS #

I made this board for a personal project.

Never use this.

I made this board using what I *think* were good tolerances.

Never use this.

I have not had the time to test this board.

Never use this.

This board is designed for AC.

Never use this.

Unless it's like 24VAC then that's okay I guess but I'm not responsible for it.
